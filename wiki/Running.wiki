There are several ways to run the app:
 # From the bulid script - {{{build run}}}
 # From a comand line - {{{runme.bat}}} or {{{runme.sh}}}
 # From your IDE - the main class is {{{com.nurflugel.util.antscriptvisualizer.AntParserUiImpl}}}
 # If you don't want to build it, the preferred option would be to run it from Java WebStart.  It's hosted on my web site : http://www.nurflugel.com/webstart/AntScriptVisualizer/antscriptVisualizer.jnlp
